Glossary
--------

body
:   The sequence of statements within a compound statement.
\index{body}

boolean expression
:   An expression whose value is either ``True`` or ``False``.
\index{boolean expression}
\index{expression!boolean}

branch
:   One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement.
\index{branch}

chained conditional
:   A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches.
\index{chained conditional}
\index{conditional!chained}

comparison operator
:   One of the operators that compares its operands: ``==``\ ,
    ``!=``\ , ``>``\ , ``<``\ , ``>=``\ , and ``<=``.

conditional statement
:   A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some
    condition.
\index{conditional statement}
\index{statement!conditional}

condition
:   The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines
    which branch is executed.
\index{condition}

compound statement
:   A statement that consists of a header and a body. The header ends
    with a colon (:). The body is indented relative to the header.
\index{compound statement}

guardian pattern
:   Where we construct a logical expression with additional comparisons
    to take advantage of the short-circuit behavior.

\index{pattern!guardian}

logical operator
:   One of the operators that combines boolean expressions:
    ``and``\ , ``or``\ , and ``not``.

nested conditional
:   A conditional statement that appears in one of the branches of
    another conditional statement.
\index{nested conditional}
\index{conditional!nested}

traceback
:   A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an
    exception occurs.
\index{traceback}

short circuit
:   When Python is part-way through evaluating a logical expression and
    stops the evaluation because Python knows the final value for the
    expression without needing to evaluate the rest of the expression.
