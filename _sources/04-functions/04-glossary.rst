Glossary
--------

algorithm
:   A general process for solving a category of problems.
\index{algorithm}

argument
:   A value provided to a function when the function is called. This
    value is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function.
\index{argument}

body
:   The sequence of statements inside a function definition.
\index{body}

composition
:   Using an expression as part of a larger expression, or a statement
    as part of a larger statement.
\index{composition}

deterministic
:   Pertaining to a program that does the same thing each time it runs,
    given the same inputs.
\index{deterministic}

dot notation
:   The syntax for calling a function in another module by specifying
    the module name followed by a dot (period) and the function name.
\index{dot notation}

flow of execution
:   The order in which statements are executed during a program run.
\index{flow of execution}

fruitful function
:   A function that returns a value.
\index{fruitful function}

function
:   A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation.
    Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a
    result.
\index{function}

function call
:   A statement that executes a function. It consists of the function
    name followed by an argument list.
\index{function call}

function definition
:   A statement that creates a new function, specifying its name,
    parameters, and the statements it executes.
\index{function definition}

function object
:   A value created by a function definition. The name of the function
    is a variable that refers to a function object.
\index{function definition}

header
:   The first line of a function definition.
\index{header}

import statement
:   A statement that reads a module file and creates a module object.
\index{import statement}
\index{statement!import}

module object
:   A value created by an ``import`` statement that provides
    access to the data and code defined in a module.
\index{module}

parameter
:   A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an
    argument.
\index{parameter}

pseudorandom
:   Pertaining to a sequence of numbers that appear to be random, but
    are generated by a deterministic program.
\index{pseudorandom}

return value
:   The result of a function. If a function call is used as an
    expression, the return value is the value of the expression.
\index{return value}

void function
:   A function that does not return a value.
\index{void function}
