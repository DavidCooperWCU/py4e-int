What to do next
============================
.. raw:: html

    <p>Click on the following link to start practice ðŸ‘‰ <b><a id="fl-next-cls">Practice</a></b></p>

.. raw:: html

    <script type="text/javascript" >

      window.onload = function() {

        a = document.getElementById("fl-next-cls")

        // randomly pick one of two relative urls
        var v = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1;
        if (v % 2 == 0)
        {
              a.href = "fl-toggle-cls.html"
        }
        else
        {
               a.href = "fl-write-cls.html"
