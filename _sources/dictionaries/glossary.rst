Glossary
--------

dictionary
:   A mapping from a set of keys to their corresponding values.

hashtable
:   The algorithm used to implement Python dictionaries.

hash function
:   A function used by a hashtable to compute the location for a key.

histogram
:   A set of counters.

implementation
:   A way of performing a computation.

item
:   Another name for a key-value pair.

key
:   An object that appears in a dictionary as the first part of a key-value pair.

key-value pair
:   The representation of the mapping from a key to a value.

lookup
:   A dictionary operation that takes a key and finds the corresponding value.

nested loops
:   When there are one or more loops "inside" of another loop. The inner loop runs to completion each time the outer loop runs once.

value
:   An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word "value".
