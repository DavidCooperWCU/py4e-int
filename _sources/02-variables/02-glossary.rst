Glossary
--------

assignment
:   A statement that assigns a value to a variable.
\index{assignment}

concatenate
:   To join two operands end to end.
\index{concatenation}

comment
:   Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or
    anyone reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution
    of the program.
\index{comment}

evaluate
:   To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to
    yield a single value.

expression
:   A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a
    single result value.
\index{expression}

floating point
:   A type that represents numbers with fractional parts.
\index{floating-point}

integer
:   A type that represents whole numbers.
\index{integer}

keyword
:   A reserved word that is used by the compiler to parse a program; you
    cannot use keywords like ``if``\ , ``def``\ , and
    ``while`` as variable names.
\index{keyword}

mnemonic
:   A memory aid. We often give variables mnemonic names to help us
    remember what is stored in the variable.
\index{mnemonic}

modulus operator
:   An operator, denoted with a percent sign (\ ``%``\ ), that
    works on integers and yields the remainder when one number is
    divided by another.

\index{operator!modulus}

operand
:   One of the values on which an operator operates.
\index{operand}

operator
:   A special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition,
    multiplication, or string concatenation.
\index{operator}

rules of precedence
:   The set of rules governing the order in which expressions involving
    multiple operators and operands are evaluated.
\index{rules of precedence}
\index{precedence}

statement
:   A section of code that represents a command or action. So far, the
    statements we have seen are assignments and print expression statement.
\index{statement}

string
:   A type that represents sequences of characters.
\index{string}

type
:   A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers
    (type ``int``\ ), floating-point numbers (type
    ``float``\ ), and strings (type ``str``\ ).
\index{type}

value
:   One of the basic units of data, like a number or string, that a
    program manipulates.
\index{value}

variable
:   A name that refers to a value.
