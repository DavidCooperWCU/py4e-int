Creativity and motivation
-------------------------

While this book is not intended for professional programmers,
professional programming can be a very rewarding job both financially
and personally. Building useful, elegant, and clever programs for others
to use is a very creative activity. Your computer or Personal Digital
Assistant (PDA) usually contains many different programs from many
different groups of programmers, each competing for your attention and
interest. They try their best to meet your needs and give you a great
user experience in the process. In some situations, when you choose a
piece of software, the programmers are directly compensated because of
your choice.

If we think of programs as the creative output of groups of programmers,
perhaps the following figure is a more sensible version of our PDA:

For now, our primary motivation is not to make money or please end
users, but instead for us to be more productive in handling the data and
information that we will encounter in our lives. When you first start,
you will be both the programmer and the end user of your programs. As
you gain skill as a programmer and programming feels more creative to
you, your thoughts may turn toward developing programs for others.
