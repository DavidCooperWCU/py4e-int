    Accumulator
      A variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result.

    Counter
      A variable used in a loop to count the number of times something happened. We initialize
      a counter to zero then increment the counter each time we want to "count" something.

    Decrement
      An update that decreases the value of a variable.

    Initialize
      An assignment that gives an initial value to a variable that will be updated.

    Increment
      An update that increases the value of a variable (often by one).

    Infinite Loop
      A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied or for which there is no
      terminating condition.

    Iteration
      Repeated execution of a set of statements using either a function that calls itself or a loop.
