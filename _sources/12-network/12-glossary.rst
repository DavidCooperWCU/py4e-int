**BeautifulSoup**
    A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from
    HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the
    HTML that browsers generally ignore. You can download the
    BeautifulSoup code from `www.crummy.com <http://www.crummy.com>`_.

**port**
    A number that generally indicates which application you are
    contacting when you make a socket connection to a server. As an
    example, web traffic usually uses port 80 while email traffic uses
    port 25.

**scrape**
    When a program pretends to be a web browser and retrieves a web
    page, then looks at the web page content. Often programs are
    following the links in one page to find the next page so they can
    traverse a network of pages or a social network.

**socket**
    A network connection between two applications where the applications
    can send and receive data in either direction.

**spider**
    The act of a web search engine retrieving a page and then all the
    pages linked from a page and so on until they have nearly all of the
    pages on the Internet which they use to build their search index.
