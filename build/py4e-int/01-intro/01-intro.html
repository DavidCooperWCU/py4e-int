  <p>Python for Everybody
Exploring Data Using Python 3
Charles R. Severance</p>
<div class="section" id="why-should-you-learn-to-write-programs">
<h1>Why should you learn to write programs?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-should-you-learn-to-write-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Writing programs (or programming) is a very creative and rewarding
activity. You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making
your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun
to helping someone else solve a problem. This book assumes that
<em>everyone</em> needs to know how to program, and that once you know how to
program you will figure out what you want to do with your newfound
skills.</p>
<p>We are surrounded in our daily lives with computers ranging from laptops
to cell phones. We can think of these computers as our “personal
assistants” who can take care of many things on our behalf. The hardware
in our current-day computers is essentially built to continuously ask us
the question, “What would you like me to do next?”</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="Personal Digital Assistant" src="../_images/pda.eps" />
</div>
<p>Programmers add an operating system and a set of applications to the
hardware and we end up with a Personal Digital Assistant that is quite
helpful and capable of helping us do many different things.</p>
<p>Our computers are fast and have vast amounts of memory and could be very
helpful to us if we only knew the language to speak to explain to the
computer what we would like it to “do next”. If we knew this language,
we could tell the computer to do tasks on our behalf that were
repetitive. Interestingly, the kinds of things computers can do best are
often the kinds of things that we humans find boring and mind-numbing.</p>
<p>For example, look at the first three paragraphs of this chapter and tell
me the most commonly used word and how many times the word is used.
While you were able to read and understand the words in a few seconds,
counting them is almost painful because it is not the kind of problem
that human minds are designed to solve. For a computer the opposite is
true, reading and understanding text from a piece of paper is hard for a
computer to do but counting the words and telling you how many times the
most used word was used is very easy for the computer:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">words</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
<span class="n">Enter</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">words</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">txt</span>
<span class="n">to</span> <span class="mi">16</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Our “personal information analysis assistant” quickly told us that the
word “to” was used sixteen times in the first three paragraphs of this
chapter.</p>
<p>This very fact that computers are good at things that humans are not is
why you need to become skilled at talking “computer language”. Once you
learn this new language, you can delegate mundane tasks to your partner
(the computer), leaving more time for you to do the things that you are
uniquely suited for. You bring creativity, intuition, and inventiveness
to this partnership.</p>

<p>While this book is not intended for professional programmers,
professional programming can be a very rewarding job both financially
and personally. Building useful, elegant, and clever programs for others
to use is a very creative activity. Your computer or Personal Digital
Assistant (PDA) usually contains many different programs from many
different groups of programmers, each competing for your attention and
interest. They try their best to meet your needs and give you a great
user experience in the process. In some situations, when you choose a
piece of software, the programmers are directly compensated because of
your choice.</p>
<p>If we think of programs as the creative output of groups of programmers,
perhaps the following figure is a more sensible version of our PDA:</p>
<div class="figure align-default">

</div>
<p>For now, our primary motivation is not to make money or please end
users, but instead for us to be more productive in handling the data and
information that we will encounter in our lives. When you first start,
you will be both the programmer and the end user of your programs. As
you gain skill as a programmer and programming feels more creative to
you, your thoughts may turn toward developing programs for others.</p>

<p>Before we start learning the language we speak to give instructions to
computers to develop software, we need to learn a small amount about how
computers are built. If you were to take apart your computer or cell
phone and look deep inside, you would find the following parts:</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="Hardware Architecture" src="../_images/arch.eps" />
</div>
<p>The high-level definitions of these parts are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>Central Processing Unit</em> (or CPU) is the part of
the computer that is built to be obsessed with “what is next?” If
your computer is rated at 3.0 Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will
ask “What next?” three billion times per second. You are going to
have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with the CPU.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Main Memory</em> is used to store information that
the CPU needs in a hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the
CPU. But the information stored in the main memory vanishes when the
computer is turned off.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Secondary Memory</em> is also used to store
information, but it is much slower than the main memory. The
advantage of the secondary memory is that it can store information
even when there is no power to the computer. Examples of secondary
memory are disk drives or flash memory (typically found in USB
sticks and portable music players).</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>Input and Output Devices</em> are simply our screen,
keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of
the ways we interact with the computer.</p></li>
<li><p>These days, most computers also have a <em>Network
Connection</em> to retrieve information over a network. We can
think of the network as a very slow place to store and retrieve data
that might not always be “up”. So in a sense, the network is a
slower and at times unreliable form of <em>Secondary
Memory</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While most of the detail of how these components work is best left to
computer builders, it helps to have some terminology so we can talk
about these different parts as we write our programs.</p>
<p>As a programmer, your job is to use and orchestrate each of these
resources to solve the problem that you need to solve and analyze the
data you get from the solution. As a programmer you will mostly be
“talking” to the CPU and telling it what to do next. Sometimes you will
tell the CPU to use the main memory, secondary memory, network, or the
input/output devices.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="Where Are You?" src="../_images/arch2.eps" />
</div>
<p>You need to be the person who answers the CPU’s “What next?” question.
But it would be very uncomfortable to shrink you down to 5mm tall and
insert you into the computer just so you could issue a command three
billion times per second. So instead, you must write down your
instructions in advance. We call these stored instructions a
<em>program</em> and the act of writing these instructions down
and getting the instructions to be correct <em>programming</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="understanding-programming">
<h2>Understanding programming<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the rest of this book, we will try to turn you into a person who is
skilled in the art of programming. In the end you will be a
<em>programmer</em> - perhaps not a professional programmer, but
at least you will have the skills to look at a data/information analysis
problem and develop a program to solve the problem.</p>
<p>index{problem solving}</p>
<p>In a sense, you need two skills to be a programmer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need
to know the vocabulary and the grammar. You need to be able to spell
the words in this new language properly and know how to construct
well-formed “sentences” in this new language.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, you need to “tell a story”. In writing a story, you combine
words and sentences to convey an idea to the reader. There is a
skill and art in constructing the story, and skill in story writing
is improved by doing some writing and getting some feedback. In
programming, our program is the “story” and the problem you are
trying to solve is the “idea”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you learn one programming language such as Python, you will find it
much easier to learn a second programming language such as JavaScript or
C++. The new programming language has very different vocabulary and
grammar but the problem-solving skills will be the same across all
programming languages.</p>
<p>You will learn the “vocabulary” and “sentences” of Python pretty
quickly. It will take longer for you to be able to write a coherent
program to solve a brand-new problem. We teach programming much like we
teach writing. We start reading and explaining programs, then we write
simple programs, and then we write increasingly complex programs over
time. At some point you “get your muse” and see the patterns on your own
and can see more naturally how to take a problem and write a program
that solves that problem. And once you get to that point, programming
becomes a very pleasant and creative process.</p>
<p>We start with the vocabulary and structure of Python programs. Be
patient as the simple examples remind you of when you started reading
for the first time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="words-and-sentences">
<h2>Words and sentences<a class="headerlink" href="#words-and-sentences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>index{programming language}
index{language!programming}</p>
<p>Unlike human languages, the Python vocabulary is actually pretty small.
We call this “vocabulary” the “reserved words”. These are words that
have very special meaning to Python. When Python sees these words in a
Python program, they have one and only one meaning to Python. Later as
you write programs you will make up your own words that have meaning to
you called <em>variables</em>. You will have great latitude in
choosing your names for your variables, but you cannot use any of
Python’s reserved words as a name for a variable.</p>
<p>When we train a dog, we use special words like “sit”, “stay”, and
“fetch”. When you talk to a dog and don’t use any of the reserved words,
they just look at you with a quizzical look on their face until you say
a reserved word. For example, if you say, “I wish more people would walk
to improve their overall health”, what most dogs likely hear is, “blah
blah blah <em>walk</em> blah blah blah blah.” That is because
“walk” is a reserved word in dog language. Many might suggest that the
language between humans and cats has no reserved words^[<a class="reference external" href="http://xkcd.com/231/">http://xkcd.com/231/</a>].</p>
<p>The reserved words in the language where humans talk to Python include
the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ow">and</span>       <span class="k">del</span>       <span class="k">global</span>      <span class="ow">not</span>       <span class="k">with</span>
<span class="k">as</span>        <span class="k">elif</span>      <span class="k">if</span>          <span class="ow">or</span>        <span class="k">yield</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That is it, and unlike a dog, Python is already completely trained. When
you say “try”, Python will try every time you say it without fail.</p>
<p>We will learn these reserved words and how they are used in good time,
but for now we will focus on the Python equivalent of “speak” (in
human-to-dog language). The nice thing about telling Python to speak is
that we can even tell it what to say by giving it a message in quotes:</p>

<div data-childcomponent="01-intro-a-hello" class="runestone explainer ac_section alert alert-warning">

<textarea data-component="activecode" id=01-intro-a-hello data-lang="python" 
      data-timelimit=25000  data-codelens="true"   
    data-audio=''      
           data-wasm=/_static>
print('Hello world!')
</textarea>
</div>
<p>And we have even written our first syntactically correct Python
sentence. Our sentence starts with the function <em>print</em>
followed by a string of text of our choosing enclosed in single quotes.
The strings in the print statements are enclosed in quotes. Single
quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single
quotes except in cases like this where a single quote (which is also an
apostrophe) appears in the string.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conversing-with-python">
<h2>Conversing with Python<a class="headerlink" href="#conversing-with-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have a word and a simple sentence that we know in Python, we
need to know how to start a conversation with Python to test our new
language skills.</p>
<p>Before you can converse with Python, you must first install the Python
software on your computer and learn how to start Python on your
computer. That is too much detail for this chapter so I suggest that you
consult <a class="reference external" href="http://www.py4e.com">www.py4e.com</a> where I have detailed
instructions and screencasts of setting up and starting Python on
Macintosh and Windows systems. At some point, you will be in a terminal
or command window and you will type <em>python</em> and the
Python interpreter will start executing in interactive mode and appear
somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code> prompt is the Python interpreter’s way of asking
you, “What do you want me to do next?” Python is ready to have a
conversation with you. All you have to know is how to speak the Python
language.</p>
<p>Let’s say for example that you did not know even the simplest Python
language words or sentences. You might want to use the standard line
that astronauts use when they land on a faraway planet and try to speak
with the inhabitants of the planet:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">come</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">peace</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">please</span> <span class="n">take</span> <span class="n">me</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">your</span> <span class="n">leader</span>
<span class="go">File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1</span>
<span class="go">  I come in peace, please take me to your leader</span>
<span class="go">       ^</span>
<span class="go">SyntaxError: invalid syntax</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is not going so well. Unless you think of something quickly, the
inhabitants of the planet are likely to stab you with their spears, put
you on a spit, roast you over a fire, and eat you for dinner.</p>
<p>Luckily you brought a copy of this book on your travels, and you thumb
to this very page and try again:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello world!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Hello world!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is looking much better, so you try to communicate some more:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;You must be the legendary god that comes from the sky&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="go">We have been waiting for you for a long time</span>

<span class="go">File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1</span>
<span class="go">  print &#39;We will have a feast tonight unless you say</span>
<span class="go">                                                   ^</span>
<span class="go">SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to &#39;print&#39;</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The conversation was going so well for a while and then you made the
tiniest mistake using the Python language and Python brought the spears
back out.</p>
<p>At this point, you should also realize that while Python is amazingly
complex and powerful and very picky about the syntax you use to
communicate with it, Python is <em>not</em> intelligent. You are
really just having a conversation with yourself, but using proper
syntax.</p>
<p>In a sense, when you use a program written by someone else the
conversation is between you and those other programmers with Python
acting as an intermediary. Python is a way for the creators of programs
to express how the conversation is supposed to proceed. And in just a
few more chapters, you will be one of those programmers using Python to
talk to the users of your program.</p>
<p>Before we leave our first conversation with the Python interpreter, you
should probably know the proper way to say “good-bye” when interacting
with the inhabitants of Planet Python:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; good-bye
Traceback (most recent call last):
File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name &#39;good&#39; is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; if you don&#39;t mind, I need to leave
File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
  if you don&#39;t mind, I need to leave
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt; quit()
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will notice that the error is different for the first two incorrect
attempts. The second error is different because <em>if</em> is a
reserved word and Python saw the reserved word and thought we were
trying to say something but got the syntax of the sentence wrong.</p>
<p>The proper way to say “good-bye” to Python is to enter
<em>quit()</em> at the interactive chevron <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>
prompt. It would have probably taken you quite a while to guess that
one, so having a book handy probably will turn out to be helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terminology-interpreter-and-compiler">
<h2>Terminology: Interpreter and compiler<a class="headerlink" href="#terminology-interpreter-and-compiler" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python is a <em>high-level</em> language intended to be
relatively straightforward for humans to read and write and for
computers to read and process. Other high-level languages include Java,
C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more. The actual
hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not understand
any of these high-level languages.</p>
<p>The CPU understands a language we call <em>machine
language</em>. Machine language is very simple and frankly very
tiresome to write because it is represented all in zeros and ones:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">001010001110100100101010000001111</span>
<span class="mi">11100110000011101010010101101101</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Machine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are
only zeros and ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more
intricate than Python. So very few programmers ever write machine
language. Instead we build various translators to allow programmers to
write in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript and these
translators convert the programs to machine language for actual
execution by the CPU.</p>
<p>Since machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine
language is not <em>portable</em> across different types of
hardware. Programs written in high-level languages can be moved between
different computers by using a different interpreter on the new machine
or recompiling the code to create a machine language version of the
program for the new machine.</p>
<p>These programming language translators fall into two general categories:
(1) interpreters and (2) compilers.</p>
<p>An <em>interpreter</em> reads the source code of the program as
written by the programmer, parses the source code, and interprets the
instructions on the fly. Python is an interpreter and when we are
running Python interactively, we can type a line of Python (a sentence)
and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another
line of Python.</p>
<p>Some of the lines of Python tell Python that you want it to remember
some value for later. We need to pick a name for that value to be
remembered and we can use that symbolic name to retrieve the value
later. We use the term <em>variable</em> to refer to the labels
we use to refer to this stored data.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">6</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">42</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example, we ask Python to remember the value six and use the
label <em>x</em> so we can retrieve the value later. We verify
that Python has actually remembered the value using
<em>print</em>. Then we ask Python to retrieve
<em>x</em> and multiply it by seven and put the newly computed
value in <em>y</em>. Then we ask Python to print out the value
currently in <em>y</em>.</p>
<p>Even though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time,
Python is treating them as an ordered sequence of statements with later
statements able to retrieve data created in earlier statements. We are
writing our first simple paragraph with four sentences in a logical and
meaningful order.</p>
<p>It is the nature of an <em>interpreter</em> to be able to have
an interactive conversation as shown above. A <em>compiler</em>
needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then it runs a
process to translate the high-level source code into machine language
and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file
for later execution.</p>
<p>If you have a Windows system, often these executable machine language
programs have a suffix of “.exe” or “.dll” which stand for “executable”
and “dynamic link library” respectively. In Linux and Macintosh, there
is no suffix that uniquely marks a file as executable.</p>
<p>If you were to open an executable file in a text editor, it would look
completely crazy and be unreadable:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>^?ELF^A^A^A^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^B^@^C^@^A^@^@^@\xa0\x82

....
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is not easy to read or write machine language, so it is nice that we
have <em>interpreters</em> and <em>compilers</em> that
allow us to write in high-level languages like Python or C.</p>
<p>Now at this point in our discussion of compilers and interpreters, you
should be wondering a bit about the Python interpreter itself. What
language is it written in? Is it written in a compiled language? When we
type “python”, what exactly is happening?</p>
<p>The Python interpreter is written in a high-level language called “C”.
You can look at the actual source code for the Python interpreter by
going to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a> and working your way to their
source code. So Python is a program itself and it is compiled into
machine code. When you installed Python on your computer (or the vendor
installed it), you copied a machine-code copy of the translated Python
program onto your system. In Windows, the executable machine code for
Python itself is likely in a file with a name like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">:</span>\<span class="n">Python35</span>\<span class="n">python</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exe</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That is more than you really need to know to be a Python programmer, but
sometimes it pays to answer those little nagging questions right at the
beginning.</p>

with Python’s features, but it is not recommended for solving more
complex problems.</p>
<p>When we want to write a program, we use a text editor to write the
Python instructions into a file, which is called a
<em>script</em>. By convention, Python scripts have names that
end with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code>.</p>
<p>index{script}</p>
<p>To execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter the name
of the file. In a command window, you would type
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">hello.py</span></code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cat hello.py
print<span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello world!&#39;</span><span class="o">)</span>
$ python hello.py
Hello world!
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The “$” is the operating system prompt, and the “cat hello.py” is
showing us that the file “hello.py” has a one-line Python program to
print a string.</p>
<p>We call the Python interpreter and tell it to read its source code from
the file “hello.py” instead of prompting us for lines of Python code
interactively.</p>
<p>You will notice that there was no need to have <em>quit()</em>
at the end of the Python program in the file. When Python is reading
your source code from a file, it knows to stop when it reaches the end
of the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-program">
<h2>What is a program?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definition of a <em>program</em> at its most basic is a
sequence of Python statements that have been crafted to do something.
Even our simple <em>hello.py</em> script is a program. It is a
one-line program and is not particularly useful, but in the strictest
definition, it is a Python program.</p>
<p>It might be easiest to understand what a program is by thinking about a
problem that a program might be built to solve, and then looking at a
program that would solve that problem.</p>
<p>Lets say you are doing Social Computing research on Facebook posts and
you are interested in the most frequently used word in a series of
posts. You could print out the stream of Facebook posts and pore over
the text looking for the most common word, but that would take a long
time and be very mistake prone. You would be smart to write a Python
program to handle the task quickly and accurately so you can spend the
weekend doing something fun.</p>
<p>For example, look at the following text about a clown and a car. Look at
the text and figure out the most common word and how many times it
occurs.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">clown</span> <span class="n">ran</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">car</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">car</span> <span class="n">ran</span> <span class="n">into</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">tent</span>
<span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">tent</span> <span class="n">fell</span> <span class="n">down</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">clown</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">car</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then imagine that you are doing this task looking at millions of lines
of text. Frankly it would be quicker for you to learn Python and write a
Python program to count the words than it would be to manually scan the
words.</p>
<p>The even better news is that I already came up with a simple program to
find the most common word in a text file. I wrote it, tested it, and now
I am giving it to you to use so you can save some time.</p>
<p>VerbatimInput{../code3/words.py}
begin{trinketfiles}
../code3/words.txt
end{trinketfiles}</p>
<p>You don’t even need to know Python to use this program. You will need to
get through Chapter 10 of this book to fully understand the awesome
Python techniques that were used to make the program. You are the end
user, you simply use the program and marvel at its cleverness and how it
saved you so much manual effort. You simply type the code into a file
called <em>words.py</em> and run it or you download the source
code from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.py4e.com/code3/">http://www.py4e.com/code3/</a> and run it.</p>
<p>index{program}</p>
<p>This is a good example of how Python and the Python language are acting
as an intermediary between you (the end user) and me (the programmer).
Python is a way for us to exchange useful instruction sequences (i.e.,
programs) in a common language that can be used by anyone who installs
Python on their computer. So neither of us are talking <em>to
Python</em>, instead we are communicating with each other
<em>through</em> Python.</p>

<p>In the next few chapters, we will learn more about the vocabulary,
sentence structure, paragraph structure, and story structure of Python.
We will learn about the powerful capabilities of Python and how to
compose those capabilities together to create useful programs.</p>
<p>There are some low-level conceptual patterns that we use to construct
programs. These constructs are not just for Python programs, they are

<p>It sounds almost too simple to be true, and of course it is never so
simple. It is like saying that walking is simply “putting one foot in
front of the other”. The “art” of writing a program is composing and
weaving these basic elements together many times over to produce
something that is useful to its users.</p>
<p>The word counting program above directly uses all of these patterns
except for one.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-could-possibly-go-wrong">
<h2>What could possibly go wrong?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-could-possibly-go-wrong" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we saw in our earliest conversations with Python, we must communicate
very precisely when we write Python code. The smallest deviation or
mistake will cause Python to give up looking at your program.</p>
<p>Beginning programmers often take the fact that Python leaves no room for
errors as evidence that Python is mean, hateful, and cruel. While Python
seems to like everyone else, Python knows them personally and holds a
grudge against them. Because of this grudge, Python takes our perfectly
written programs and rejects them as “unfit” just to torment us.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; primt &#39;Hello world!&#39;
File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1

</div>
<p>There is little to be gained by arguing with Python. It is just a tool.
It has no emotions and it is happy and ready to serve you whenever you
need it. Its error messages sound harsh, but they are just Python’s call
for help. It has looked at what you typed, and it simply cannot
understand what you have entered.</p>
<p>Python is much more like a dog, loving you unconditionally, having a few
key words that it understands, looking you with a sweet look on its face
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>), and waiting for you to say something it
understands. When Python says “SyntaxError: invalid syntax”, it is
simply wagging its tail and saying, “You seemed to say something but I
just don’t understand what you meant, but please keep talking to me
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>).”</p>
<p>As your programs become increasingly sophisticated, you will encounter
three general types of errors:</p>
<p>Syntax errors
:   These are the first errors you will make and the easiest to fix. A</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">C:\Users\shrij\Runestone\py4e-int\_sources\01-intro\01-intro.rst</span>, line 738)</p>
<p>Unexpected indentation.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div><p>syntax error means that you have violated the “grammar” rules of
Python. Python does its best to point right at the line and
character where it noticed it was confused. The only tricky bit of
syntax errors is that sometimes the mistake that needs fixing is
actually earlier in the program than where Python
<em>noticed</em> it was confused. So the line and character
that Python indicates in a syntax error may just be a starting point
for your investigation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Logic errors
:   A logic error is when your program has good syntax but there is a</p>
<div class="system-message">

</div>
<blockquote>
<div><p>mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how
the statements relate to one another. A good example of a logic
error might be, “take a drink from your water bottle, put it in your
backpack, walk to the library, and then put the top back on the
bottle.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Semantic errors
:   A semantic error is when your description of the steps to take is</p>
<div class="system-message">

<p>Unexpected indentation.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div><p>syntactically perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a
mistake in the program. The program is perfectly correct but it does
not do what you <em>intended</em> for it to do. A simple
example would be if you were giving a person directions to a
restaurant and said, “…when you reach the intersection with the
gas station, turn left and go one mile and the restaurant is a red
building on your left.” Your friend is very late and calls you to
tell you that they are on a farm and walking around behind a barn,
with no sign of a restaurant. Then you say “did you turn left or
right at the gas station?” and they say, “I followed your directions
perfectly, I have them written down, it says turn left and go one
mile at the gas station.” Then you say, “I am very sorry, because
while my instructions were syntactically correct, they sadly
contained a small but undetected semantic error.”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Again in all three types of errors, Python is merely trying its hardest
to do exactly what you have asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugging">
<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>index{debugging}</p>
<p>When you Python spits out an error or even when it gives you a result that is different from what you had intended, then begins the hunt for the cause of the error. Debugging is the process of finding the cause of the error in your code. When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug, there are four things to try:</p>
<p>reading
:   Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>if you display the right thing at the right place in the program,

<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">C:\Users\shrij\Runestone\py4e-int\_sources\01-intro\01-intro.rst</span>, line 794)</p>
<p>Unexpected indentation.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div><p>semantic? What information can you get from the error messages, or
from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause the
problem you’re seeing? What did you change last, before the problem

<div class="system-message">

<p>Unexpected indentation.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div><p>changes, until you get back to a program that works and that you
understand. Then you can start rebuilding.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and
forget the others.  Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others. Each activity comes with its own failure mode.</p>
<p>index{typographical error}</p>
<p>For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a
typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual
misunderstanding. If you don’t understand what your program does, you
can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in
your head.</p>
<p>index{experimental debugging}</p>
<p>Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests.
But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you
might fall into a pattern I call “random walk programming”, which is the
process of making random changes until the program does the right thing.
Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time.</p>
<p>index{random walk programming}
index{development plan!random walk programming}</p>
<p>You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental
science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem
is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to think of a test that
would eliminate one of them.</p>
<p>Taking a break helps with the thinking. So does talking. If you explain
the problem to someone else (or even to yourself), you will sometimes
find the answer before you finish asking the question.</p>
<p>But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many
errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and complicated.
Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the program until
you get to something that works and that you understand.</p>
<p>Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can’t
stand to delete a line of code (even if it’s wrong). If it makes you
feel better, copy your program into another file before you start
stripping it down. Then you can paste the pieces back in a little bit at
a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-learning-journey">
<h2>The learning journey<a class="headerlink" href="#the-learning-journey" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As you progress through the rest of the book, don’t be afraid if the
concepts don’t seem to fit together well the first time. When you were
learning to speak, it was not a problem for your first few years that
you just made cute gurgling noises. And it was OK if it took six months
for you to move from simple vocabulary to simple sentences and took 5-6
more years to move from sentences to paragraphs, and a few more years to
be able to write an interesting complete short story on your own.</p>
<p>We want you to learn Python much more rapidly, so we teach it all at the
same time over the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new
language that takes time to absorb and understand before it feels
natural. That leads to some confusion as we visit and revisit topics to
try to get you to see the big picture while we are defining the tiny
fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written
linearly, and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear
fashion, don’t hesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach the
material. Look forwards and backwards and read with a light touch. By
skimming more advanced material without fully understanding the details,
you can get a better understanding of the “why?” of programming. By
reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier exercises, you will
realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the material
you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable.</p>
<p>Usually when you are learning your first programming language, there are
a few wonderful “Ah Hah!” moments where you can look up from pounding
away at some rock with a hammer and chisel and step away and see that
you are indeed building a beautiful sculpture.</p>
<p>If something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in
staying up all night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a
snack, explain what you are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps
your dog), and then come back to it with fresh eyes. I assure you that
once you learn the programming concepts in the book you will look back
and see that it was all really easy and elegant and it simply took you a
bit of time to absorb it.</p>
