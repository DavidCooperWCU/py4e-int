Visualizing data
----------------

So far we have been learning the Python language and then learning how
to use Python, the network, and databases to manipulate data.

In this chapter, we take a look at three complete applications that
bring all of these things together to manage and visualize data. You
might use these applications as sample code to help get you started in
solving a real-world problem.

Each of the applications is a ZIP file that you can download and extract
onto your computer and execute.
