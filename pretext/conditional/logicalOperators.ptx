  <title>Logical operators</title>
  <p xml:id="conditional_index-0">There are three <em>logical operators</em>: <c>and</c>,
            <c>or</c>, and <c>not</c>. The semantics (meaning) of these
            operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example,</p>
  <p><c>x &gt; 0 and x &lt; 10</c> is true only if <c>x</c> is greater than 0 <em>and</em> less than 10.</p>
  <p><c>n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0</c> is true if <em>either</em> of the conditions
            is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 <em>or</em> 3.</p>
  <p>Finally, the <c>not</c> operator negates a boolean expression, so
            <c>not (x &gt; y)</c> is true if <c>x &gt; y</c> is false; that
            is, if <c>x</c> is less than or equal to <c>y</c>.</p>
  <p>Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be
            boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number
            is interpreted as <q>true.</q></p>

  <p>This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that
            might be confusing. You might want to avoid it until you are sure you
            know what you are doing.</p>

      <p>Q-2: What is a correct Python expression for checking to see if a number stored in a variable x is between 0 and 5?</p>
    </statement>
    <choices>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>x &gt; 0 and &lt; 5</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Try again. Each comparison must be between exactly two values.  In this case the right-hand expression &lt; 5 lacks a value on its left.</p>

        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Try agian. Although this is legal Python syntax, the expression is incorrect.  It will evaluate to true for all numbers that are either greater than 0 or less than 5.  Because all numbers are either greater than 0 or less than 5, this expression will always be True.</p>

        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Correct! With an and keyword both expressions must be true so the number must be greater than 0 an less than 5 for this expression to be true. Although most other programming languages do not allow this mathematical syntax, in Python, you could also write 0 &lt; x &lt; 5.</p>
