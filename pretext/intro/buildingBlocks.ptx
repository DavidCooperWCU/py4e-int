  <title>The building blocks of programs</title>
  <p xml:id="intro_building_blocks_index-0">In the next few chapters, we will learn more about the vocabulary,
            sentence structure, paragraph structure, and story structure of Python.
            We will learn about the powerful capabilities of Python and how to
            compose those capabilities together to create useful programs.</p>
  <p>There are some low-level conceptual patterns that we use to construct
            programs. These constructs are not just for Python programs, they are
            part of every programming language from machine language up to the
            high-level languages.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>input</title>
            <p>Get data from the <q>outside world</q>. This might be reading data from a
                                file, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our
                                initial programs, our input will come from the user typing data on
                                the keyboard.</p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>output</title>
            <p>Display the results of the program on a screen or store them in a
                                file or perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music
                                or speak text.</p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>sequential execution</title>
            <p>Perform statements one after another in the order they are
                                encountered in the script.</p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>conditional execution</title>
            <p>Check for certain conditions and then execute or skip a sequence of
                                statements.</p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>repeated execution</title>
            <p>Perform some set of statements repeatedly, usually with some
                                variation.</p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>reuse</title>
            <p>Write a set of instructions once and give them a name and then reuse
                                those instructions as needed throughout your program.</p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>It sounds almost too simple to be true, and of course it is never so
            simple. It is like saying that walking is simply <q>putting one foot in
            front of the other</q>. The <q>art</q> of writing a program is composing and
            weaving these basic elements together many times over to produce
            something that is useful to its users.</p>
  <p>The word counting program from the previous section directly uses all of these patterns
            except for one.</p>
